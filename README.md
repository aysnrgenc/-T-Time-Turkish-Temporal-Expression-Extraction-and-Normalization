# ITUTime Turkish Temporal Expression Extraction and Normalization

We introduce a rule based temporal expression tagger, ITUTime for detecting and normalizing temporal expressions in Turkish language. ITUTime simply running over free text and free of any preprocessing tool. To develop and evaluate system, we prepared very first Turkish temporally annotated dataset. We follow TimeML 1.2.1 annotation guidline while preparing this dataset and annotated manually with brat annotation tool {https://brat.nlplab.org/index.html}. We collected 109 news articles from https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ between 03.03.2018 and 19.03.2018. Collected articles belongs to different types such as sports, political, travel, economy. Each file contains DCT(document creation time) in first line. Also you can see type and id of news in the end of file.
To contirbute to future works, our test dataset is publicly available in this repo.
